occasionally, i make bread. my latest project has been [brioche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brioche). i've tried making it a few times with little success. the broad strokes of making brioche are 

1. combine ingredients and have your stand mixer knead the dough for about 30 minutes
2. cover; let it rise for an hour at room temp
3. refrigerate dough for a good long fermentation period
4. shape and allow it to rise again at room temp
5. bake

the challenges i've faced in my three attempts can attributed to two things, i think:

- not knowing quite what to expect from the dough at each step of the process, and
- overreliance on a [single learning resource](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/brioche-recipe). 

for my first two attempts, i followed the king arthur recipe exactly. after a night in the fridge, the dough was completely dried out on top, and it hadn't risen at all. i didn't even try to shape the dough or bake it at that point; i just tossed the dough.

i read up on some [brioche tips and tricks](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2009/02/22/brioche-bring-it-on), and the author was adament that just following the directions to the letter would lead to success. i thought ... maybe the dough was just supposed to be hard and a little dry after a night in the refrigerator? time for a third iteration and some adjusted expectations.

when i took the third ball of dough out of the fridge, it still felt wrong, but i pushed ahead with shaping it into two small loaves, letting it rise, and baking it.

the outcome was appropriately mediocre. it was overbaked and dry, but the brioche flavor was there, and i had a baseline to work with.

i learned a couple things:

- for my first two attempts, i had expected the dough to rise in the fridge overnight. that didn't really make sense, though, because the cold temperature hardens the butter, which prevents the dough from rising. putting it in the fridge allows the dough to ferment for a long time without rising. the thing i thought was a sign of failure turned out to be _the literal point_. life lesson or whatever.
- you can make some pretty good french toast with mediocre brioche.

time for more research! 

i consulted the [baking bible](https://www.realbakingwithrose.com/the-baking-bible) to see what it had to say about the process. in general, i find the recipes in this book too involved for me to actually execute on, but it's a wonderful resource when i'm looking for a better understanding of how and why things are done the way they're done.

as i anticipated, the baking bible's brioche recipe was far more complex than king arthur's. but there were some vital takeaways:

- it's okay to handle/work the dough more than you would with a typical flour/water/salt/yeast bread. 
- you can put the dough in a gallon ziploc before putting it in the fridge to reduce air exposure. i had been leaving it in the mixing bowl and putting cling wrap on top, and that wasn't cutting it. 

here we go. attempt four. i followed the king arthur recipe with just two edits: 

- i put the dough in a ziploc before refrigerating
- i was far more intrepid about shaping the dough after refrigerating. i divided it into halves and then divided those into three strands each to braid. 

to my surprise and delight, it turned out better than i thought. there are things i'll do differently next time, like doing an egg wash and braiding the loaves more tightly, but i'm happy with the evolution of my brioche so far.
